Machine learning model for predicting Sales
Sales Prediction Model
This repository hosts a machine learning model designed to predict sales based on various factors. It uses Python and Scikit-Learn for development and leverages datasets within the data/ directory.

Features
Training: Scripts available in src/ train the model using specified datasets.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance with provided test data using src/evaluate_model.py.
Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data via src/make_predictions.py.
Setup and Usage
Prerequisites: Python 3.x and required libraries (specified in requirements.txt).
Clone: Clone the repository and install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Training: Run train_model.py script specifying the training data and desired output path.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance with evaluate_model.py by providing the model path and test data.
Predictions: Use make_predictions.py with the model path and new data to generate predictions.
